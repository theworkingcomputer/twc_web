** Read First **

This is the initial readme for the Working Computer, including all the non-private (not for paying customers) code and resources for the website.

My intention is all of my code is in the public domain with only attribution required with public usage or comment, otherwise free to use for any purpose. More on that in the license section later. This is in keeping with my thought that the only way to utilize information technology with maximum safety is to use it with maximum transparency.

Feel free, all who enter here, use or comment as you will. Let me know if you have any questions at david@theworkingcomputer.com.

Thanks.
